# hello-world
I'm learning code

Hey everyone

I'm new to coding and programming. I recently picked up one of those "for dummy books" and realized that although I want to learn code reading the book wasn't making sense. So I'm on here now hoping to take on some projects to get a hang of it.

If anyone cares I've recently started messing around with Python and I'm using the Jupyter's notebook environment.

Thanks

Marc
